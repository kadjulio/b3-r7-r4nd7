# Note: I would have preferred to do this in Golang. It would be a lot faster with Golang.
# I thought about using C++, but the hassle with loading and working with json stopped me doing so.
# This approach is now much shorter and better understandable.

        # Do the actual calculation. I use the dijkstar python module here, because of a few reasons:
        # 1. Technical debt: I am not a mathematician, therefore it cost me time to implement a fully working dijkstra
        #    single-source shortest-path algorithm by my self. To reduce the cost, I use an implementation by an actual
        #    mathematician. I did code a dijkstra algorithm in C++ during my studies,
        #    but why investing unnecessary time?
        #    In the end it's my time that will be wasted or the time/money of my future employee ;)
        # 2. Complexity: I am not a mathematician, so I will let others do the work in implementing an error-free
        #    dijkstra algorithm
        # 3. Open Source: I think it's better to use existing solutions, and provide patches for these
        #    solutions if they are erroneous. With this workflow we can focus on the actual work and save time/money.
        # 4. I am mostly interested in DevOps and Site-Reliability Engineering.
        #    So I went with the shortest solution as possible with the best effect. This way I can reduce toil.
